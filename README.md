# TripAdvisor_crawler
This project can help you scrape hotel information from Tripadvisor. I divide the process into three steps as following:
## Step1
 In tripadvisor_page.py, scrape and save hotels' basic information ex. hotal name, url, number of comments, hotel rank in country, etc. 
## Step2
 In tripadvisor_page.py, scrape hotels' detailed information baesd on Step1 output ex. hotel website, star, price, latlon, etc.
## Step3
 In data_manipulation.py, do feature engineering or regular expression to extact content on Step2 output.
 
**Before you start, change the setting:**
1. Use Chromedriver or PhantomJS
2. Set your file path
3. set your main url
